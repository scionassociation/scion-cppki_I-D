How else can the document be improved?\r\n \r\n> I\u2019m a believer. It\u2019s a good set of solutions. Using a PKI is a good solution. As is the current RPKI and ROA\u2019s. It might also be helpful, in the scion control plan pki document, to at least acknowledge RPKI. RPKI is widely used now and it could be helpful to understand how scions use of PKI would be similar and different. In the long run it would give operators a more comfortable understanding since most now use RPKI.  \r\nWe could add a couple of sentences about this. We have some text in the now expired [draft-rustignoli-panrg-scion-components](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-rustignoli-panrg-scion-components-03.t): \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have some text in the now expired [draft-rustignoli-panrg-scion-components](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-rustignoli-panrg-scion-components-03.t): \r\n```\r\n   The above-mentioned decoupling also implies that SCION does not\r\n   provide, by design, IP prefix origin validation, which is currently\r\n   provided by RPKI [RFC8210].  As prefix origin validation is outside\r\n   of SCION's scope, IP-to-SCION's coexistence mechanisms (SIAM, SBAS)\r\n   later discussed in Section 3.1 build on top of RPKI for IP origin\r\n   attestation.\r\n   ... \r\n   These properties would be lost if SCION were to rely on an existing\r\n   PKI (i.e., the web PKI, the RPKI, ...).  For example, if SCION were\r\n   to use the RPKI instead of the CP-PKI, its control plane would lack\r\n   the trust model required to support Isolation Domains.  This is\r\n   because RPKI's trust model follows the same structure as the IP\r\n   allocation hierarchy, where the five RIRs represent the trust roots.\r\n```",

If a CA is compromised or malicious, this power can unavoidably be abused. A misbehaving CA can plainly refuse to issue certificates to legitimate entities, or even issue illegitimate certificates to allow impersonating another entity. In the context of the SCION control plane PKI, refusing an AS to obtain or renew their AS certificate will ultimately cut the AS off from the network, turning the CP-PKI into a network \"kill switch\".

For the control plane messages, this is simplified by the observation that the sender of a message (e.g. of a path construction beacon during path exploration or a path segment during a path lookup) always has all the cryptographic material to verify it. Thus, the receiver can always immediately obtain all the cryptographic material from the message originator.\r\nAs the corresponding PKI messaging thus only occurs when the control plane is already communicating, these requests to obtain cryptographic material are not prone to additional denial of service attacks. We therefore refer to {{I-D.scion-cp}} for a more detailed description of DoS vulnerabilities of control-plane messages.\r\n\r\nFor certificate renewal, on the other hand, this does not apply.\r\nDenial of Service on the CA infrastructure or on the communication links from the individual ASes to the CA, could be used by an attacker to refuse victim ASes from  renewing their certificates. After the short-lived certificates expire, an AS is effectively banished from the network.\r\nTo address this risk, the individual isolation domains and/or CAs should have policies and processes to renew certificates out-of-band.\r\n```",

Secondly, the single root of trust represents a single point of failure, the misuse of which enables the forging of certificates. Also, its revocation can result in a kill-switch for all the entities it certifies. The oligopoly model relies on several roots of trust, all equally and completely trusted. However, this is not automatically better: Whereas the monopoly model has a single point of failure, the oligopoly model has the drawback of exposing more than one point of failure.\r\n```\r\nThis is not about SCION< so I'd use lowercase",

Instead of periodically signing a new revocation list, the CA can simply re-issue all the non-revoked certificates. Although the overhead of signing multiple certificates is greater than that of signing a single revocation list, the overall complexity of the system is reduced. In the CP-PKI the number of certificates that each CA must renew is manageable as it is limited to at most the number of ASes within an ISD.\r\n```",

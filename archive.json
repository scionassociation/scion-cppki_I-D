How else can the document be improved?\r\n \r\n> I\u2019m a believer. It\u2019s a good set of solutions. Using a PKI is a good solution. As is the current RPKI and ROA\u2019s. It might also be helpful, in the scion control plan pki document, to at least acknowledge RPKI. RPKI is widely used now and it could be helpful to understand how scions use of PKI would be similar and different. In the long run it would give operators a more comfortable understanding since most now use RPKI.  \r\nWe could add a couple of sentences about this. We have some text in the now expired [draft-rustignoli-panrg-scion-components](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-rustignoli-panrg-scion-components-03.t): \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have some text in the now expired [draft-rustignoli-panrg-scion-components](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-rustignoli-panrg-scion-components-03.t): \r\n```\r\n   The above-mentioned decoupling also implies that SCION does not\r\n   provide, by design, IP prefix origin validation, which is currently\r\n   provided by RPKI [RFC8210].  As prefix origin validation is outside\r\n   of SCION's scope, IP-to-SCION's coexistence mechanisms (SIAM, SBAS)\r\n   later discussed in Section 3.1 build on top of RPKI for IP origin\r\n   attestation.\r\n   ... \r\n   These properties would be lost if SCION were to rely on an existing\r\n   PKI (i.e., the web PKI, the RPKI, ...).  For example, if SCION were\r\n   to use the RPKI instead of the CP-PKI, its control plane would lack\r\n   the trust model required to support Isolation Domains.  This is\r\n   because RPKI's trust model follows the same structure as the IP\r\n   allocation hierarchy, where the five RIRs represent the trust roots.\r\n```",

While the general X.509 standard, as described in ITU-T X.520, prescribes the data type PrintableString for countryName and serialNumber, SCION generally requires UTF-8 coding. Such contradictions to the standard can lead to complications in various contexts, such as directory services and their schemas.\n\nValidity - The draft states that GeneralizedTime is not permitted and must be rejected, allowing only UTCTime.

Instead of withdrawing certificates that are no longer trustworthy, certificates that are still valid are reissued again and again.\n\nWith a certificate validity period of three days and a grace period of approx. 1.5 days, the entire stock of valid certificates is renewed every 1.5 days. This places extremely high demands on the reliability of a CP-PKI and therefore also a high load on the CP-PKI systems. Although no comparison to loads on streaming portals, this concept is certainly not energy-efficient.\n\nThis load increases linearly with the growth of ASes within an ISD, and it will probably be the large, general-purpose ISDs that are orientated towards a lower trust level and cannot afford the financial or human resources to operate a highly available CP-PKI. Could the criticality of CP-PKI become a disabler of SCION technology?\n\nSCION delegates authorization to the CP-PKI, but certificates should only be used to authenticate. Currently, whoever possesses an AS Certificate is enabled to communicate but this keeps the discussed attack window open.\n\nDoes SCION implement other mechanisms to exclude malicious participants? Something like a PCB-blocking, decided and issued by the core ASes as such an incident is reported to them? What are the consequences to leaf nodes attached to any blocked / not re-certified node in general?\n",

The public key contained within the link certificate is the one of the new root key. The link certificate technically looks like a certificate issued to a sub-CA, but it is used differently. It has a shorter lifetime and must not be used to sign any other certificates. It is solely used to transfer the trust from the old root key to the new key. The old key confirms the rise of the new one.\n\nThe current strategy to let the CA sign the new TRC with the old CA key also works, but it requires a TRC update. On the other hand, link certificates would not require a TRC update, but the clients would need to maintain the list of link certificates from the root in the TRC down to the current CA certificate which also introduces some complexity.\n",

Is there any progress of the process in this respect since the SSFN implementation?\n\n**Short certificate lifetime:**\n\nThe SCION draft still recommends very short lifetimes for Root CA and Issuing CA certificates of 1 year or 11 days (!), respectively. Renewal in such short lifetimes will kill any operations team running certain commercial products. These products are sold in conjunction with HSM and much longer certificate lifetimes than those that were e.g. implemented for SSFN. Anybody wanting to implement the recommended lifetimes needs to look for a capable solution.\n\n**Control Plane AS Certificates:**\n\nThe recommended validity of 3 days is fair, but then the initialization processes must be stable and effective. Could SIX provide any experience based feedback on how much the end users relied on a longer duration for initial AS certificates when onboarding to SSFN?\n\n**Processes**\n\nThe draft talks a lot about the technical elements of a CP-PKI, but not much about processes the PKI operators have to implement. or the regulations.\n\n**Cost of Ownership**\n\nThe range extends from simple technical systems focussing on stable network communication at affordable costs to highly secure environments that place great value on reliable network communication in combination with a high level of data protection. Those with higher security requirements should be willing to bear the higher security costs through secure processes, but only those with technical requirements should be exempt from additional costs as far as possible.\n\n**High availability in CAs**\n\n1. Must the CAs of an ISD offer backup CA services to all the other PKIs in the ISD?\n2. What if a single PKI fails to operate?\n3. To cope with this single point of failure, it should be specified that the subscribers could quickly switch over to one of the other PKIs to be able to renew their certificates on time.\n4. How is the subscriber database synchronized among the different backup CAs, as without a specification the SCION world will face incompatible implementation-specific approaches.",

      "body": "Brian Trammell's comments...\n\nThe SCION Control Plane PKI draft (PKI; draft-dekater-scion-pki-10) defines the trust architecture that underpins the entire SCION system. It establishes a framework for authenticating control plane messages and path information through a novel, domain-based trust model. It specifies the cryptographic underpinnings constituting ISDs and the trust relationships within them. A Trust Root Configuration (TRC) acts as the trust anchor for an ISD, containing the root certificates needed to validate a hierarchy of CA and AS certificates, as well as the policies for its own evolution through regular and sensitive updates.\n\nThis approach provides what the document calls \"trust agility,\" allowing different parts of the network to operate under distinct, self-contained trust environments, a significant departure from the global, monolithic trust models of the web PKI. Instead of traditional certificate revocation lists, the CP-PKI relies on relatively short-lived certificates and TRC updates to manage compromised keys. The PKI is the foundation upon which the SCION Control Plane (CP) builds its secure beaconing and path discovery mechanisms, and by extension, provides the trust necessary for the Data Plane (DP) to forward packets along authenticated paths.\n\nThe document is well put together (aside from a few nits) and explains the functionality of the PKI well. The questions I have mainly concern the operational consequences of the certificate management periods at each level of the hierarchy down from the TRC: the grace and overlap periods seem from first principles to be sufficient to manage availability risk due to higher-frequency key rotation, but it would be interesting to see how this plays out in reality (I can't really think of a way to analyze this except in production, or with a questionably-applicable simulation).\n\nFurther \"out there\", I'd also be interested in exploring how the PKI itself could be incrementally applied to routing security with the existing interdomain control plane (this idea is inchoate enough that I can't really seriously elaborate it further in the context of a review).\n\n_KM - I think these are philosophical questions._",

This should be comparably shorter than expiration (I'd assume something on the order of dozens of minutes to few hours at most).\r\n\r\nTo me, only discussing (the lack of) revocations in the security considerations section does indeed not seem ideal. This is a big design decision and should be discussed front and center.\r\n\r\nThe book has a short and clearly written section on this topic (3.1.10 Substitutes to Certificate Revocation) that we could adapt.

For the control plane messages, this is simplified by the observation that the sender of a message (e.g. of a path construction beacon during path exploration or a path segment during a path lookup) always has all the cryptographic material to verify it. Thus, the receiver can always immediately obtain all the cryptographic material from the message originator.\r\nAs the corresponding PKI messaging thus only occurs when the control plane is already communicating, these requests to obtain cryptographic material are not prone to additional denial of service attacks. We therefore refer to {{I-D.scion-cp}} for a more detailed description of DoS vulnerabilities of control-plane messages.\r\n\r\nFor certificate renewal, on the other hand, this does not apply.\r\nDenial of Service on the CA infrastructure or on the communication links from the individual ASes to the CA, could be used by an attacker to refuse victim ASes from  renewing their certificates. After the short-lived certificates expire, an AS is effectively banished from the network.\r\nTo address this risk, the individual isolation domains and/or CAs should have policies and processes to renew certificates out-of-band.\r\n```",
